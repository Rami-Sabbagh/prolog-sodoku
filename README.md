A **work-in-progress** sudoku solver being written in [prolog] using [swi-prolog].

## Why prolog?

Because sudoku is a puzzle game that can be solved using propositional logic alone as a satisfiability problem.

And prolog is a well known system for solving those satisfiability problems with a specialized syntax that eases the syntax writing.

## Inspiration

Kenneth H. Rosen mentions in his "Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications" book that Sudoku is such a game that can be solved using propositional logic.

And after solving the Light-Up puzzle game as a project for my University I've decided to give Sudoku a try.
